# 👋 Hi, I'm Devanshu Khadka

I'm a Master's student in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago and a recent graduate of Virginia Tech, where I earned dual degrees in Computer Science and Computational Modeling & Data Analytics.

My passion lies in software development, data analytics, and cloud technologies, where I combine technical depth with real-world problem-solving. I've worked on full-stack applications, end-to-end AI pipelines, and large-scale data scraping projects across academic, research, and internship settings.
